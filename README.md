If you want a book which it's lent, you can talk with the actual responsible to know when it will be free.
* **Communication**:
  
  Our communication is in [Slack](https://slack.com/). 
  Communication is one of our values as a company and we think it's very important!

  Every morning at 10:00 am, we do our **Scrum Daily** with all teams in Slack: 
  * Development - iOS, Android and Web
  * Design
  * Management
  
  We use teams channels to do our Scrum Daily

* **Trello**:
  
  We use [Trello](https://trello.com/) to manage our work and analyze our tasks progress. 
  
  You can acess our team in Trello [here](https://trello.com/meteacolher/) and we have a board for each team:

  * [Management](https://trello.com/b/a03CBRdf)

* **Jobtracking**:
  
  We are developing a little system to track our work time but currently we use [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bf5iWwV11kE6faCvVgGxeKg7SZaiUU3-U77vMv-yDGw) sheet to track our job.
  You just put the date with time of work, what you did and if you have some troubles or find a new link of study or anything else in observations.

* **Workshop/Presentation**:

  We are creating a culture of share knowledge. Then, once a month we are having a workshop or presentation moment which one person of development, design or business are going to talk about a new thing that she learned. 
  We plan start in September and each meeting will be in the end of each month.

  We are also thinking to create external meetings to the community to share with them.

  We will provide soon how will be these moments and how you can "submit" your workshop/presentation!

* **Happy hour**:

  We'll have a happy hour moment each Friday in the end of each month.
  It will be a moment to talk about of our life, know each other better with some :beer:. Just a little time to have fun and relax!

  We'll talk about of our happy hour in **#random** channel in Slack.
